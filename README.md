<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72292326/136656848-46fae12a-8f70-401e-976a-0483806231b0.png)

The Project “Multi User Collaborative Document” is based on the  idea of a Collaborative document workspace.Users along with their team members or different sets of user can work together on the same document through this tool. Now for a set of users to work on same document they require  a unique key which will let them access the unique shared document in which their other team members will also be contributing.The Document gets updated in real time basis so all the users working on a shared document can see what other contributors are writing and can edit it if necessary.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

A Collaborative Document can be used for teams working on the same project. Instead of working on separate documents, they can use the Collaborative Document to work together in real time.
Any changes made in the doc will be visible to all users with the link so the same document doesn’t need to be shared multiple times. This saves time and increases efficiency in working.
